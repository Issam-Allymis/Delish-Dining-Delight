# DelishDiningDelight Project portfolio 4

![banner](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/c7a21173-3058-4e18-beea-f59872654ce6)

The blog's initial design and feature set deviated from my original intent. Originally conceived with a broader range of functionalities, I opted for a simplified approach due to time constraints and the realization that a more intricate project would be challenging to deliver within the available timeframe. The complexity became overwhelming, and it became evident that meeting the desired standards would be a considerable challenge given the time limitations incurred during my academic pursuits.
So, I have put together this simple recipe blog that's all about easy vibes and good food. Picture a laid-back design splashed with colors and mouth-watering images, urging the user to get outdoors and whip up some tasty dishes! If you're feeling chatty, you can sign up to drop comments and likes on your favorite recipes. 
And for the behind-the-scenes magic, I have hooked up the admin side. Admins can create, read, update, delete posts and comments, also known as (CRUD). It's like a backstage pass to keep things in check.
The goal? Blend simplicity with eye candy and throw in some interactive flair. The result? A cozy corner where you're not just scrolling through recipes, but diving into the conversation and sharing your foodie delicious thoughts.

### Tasks
The tasks during the development of this project were closely aligned with Code Institute's "I Think Therefore I Blog" walkthrough project, following a specific order:

### Before the project commencement
* Design Wireframes
* Create a repository in GitHub
* Establish Project, Epics, User Stories, and prepare the Kanban board

### Creating the project in Gitpod
* Initiating the project in Gitpod
* Setting up the Django project
* Deploying to Heroku
* Creating database models
* Constructing the Admin site
* Configuring templates
* Installing Allauth for sign-in, sign-up, and log-out pages
* Incorporating Crispy forms to enhance the styling of the Django Admin account
* Conducting manual and automatic testing, as well as validation checks for each page
* Final deployment

## Visual Design
### Wireframes
I utilised [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to craft the initial wireframes, outlining the intended appearance and structure of the blog. However, as the development progressed, I made the decision to omit certain features that were initially planned.

<img width="49" alt="colour 3" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/75f0fb7b-27bf-481d-9d1f-25bd194dad60">

<img width="67" alt="colour 4" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/ed3348d4-cfc3-441b-a921-539aa1a486b6">

I selected black, red, and grey for their eye-friendly appeal, and the straightforward, laid-back aesthetic significantly enhances the prominence of the images.

## Fonts
I explored font options for this web design on the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website, settling on these fonts to impart a sense of elegance and cleanliness to the overall look.

## Icons
<img width="386" alt="footer" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/b181bc8f-b843-49f1-9d92-64d83aac0585">

The navigation bar is consistently positioned at the top of each page. I incorporated the "fixed-top" attribute with Bootstrap to ensure the bar remains fixed at the top, providing users with convenient navigation, even as they scroll down.
