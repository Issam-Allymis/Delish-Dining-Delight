# DelishDiningDelight Project portfolio 4

![banner](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/c7a21173-3058-4e18-beea-f59872654ce6)

The blog's initial design and feature set deviated from my original intent. Originally conceived with a broader range of functionalities, I opted for a simplified approach due to time constraints and the realization that a more intricate project would be challenging to deliver within the available timeframe. The complexity became overwhelming, and it became evident that meeting the desired standards would be a considerable challenge given the time limitations incurred during my academic pursuits.
So, I have put together this simple recipe blog that's all about easy vibes and good food. Picture a laid-back design splashed with colors and mouth-watering images, urging the user to get outdoors and whip up some tasty dishes! If you're feeling chatty, you can sign up to drop comments and likes on your favorite recipes. 
And for the behind-the-scenes magic, I have hooked up the admin side. Admins can create, read, update, delete posts and comments, also known as (CRUD). It's like a backstage pass to keep things in check.
The goal? Blend simplicity with eye candy and throw in some interactive flair. The result? A cozy corner where you're not just scrolling through recipes, but diving into the conversation and sharing your foodie delicious thoughts.

### Tasks
The tasks during the development of this project were closely aligned with Code Institute's "I Think Therefore I Blog" walkthrough project, following a specific order:

### Before the project commencement
* Design Wireframes
* Create a repository in GitHub
* Establish Project, Epics, User Stories, and prepare the Kanban board

### Creating the project in Gitpod
* Initiating the project in Gitpod
* Setting up the Django project
* Deploying to Heroku
* Creating database models
* Constructing the Admin site
* Configuring templates
* Installing Allauth for sign-in, sign-up, and log-out pages
* Incorporating Crispy forms to enhance the styling of the Django Admin account
* Conducting manual and automatic testing, as well as validation checks for each page
* Final deployment

## Visual Design
### Wireframes
I utilised [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to craft the initial wireframes, outlining the intended appearance and structure of the blog. However, as the development progressed, I made the decision to omit certain features that were initially planned.

## Colours

- <img width="62" alt="colour 2" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/b96eea47-a491-4242-9089-8c78514c6e22">

- <img width="47" alt="colour 1" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/c6209b92-3c33-4e4d-b16d-a6da631a0964">

- <img width="49" alt="colour 3" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/75f0fb7b-27bf-481d-9d1f-25bd194dad60">

- <img width="67" alt="colour 4" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/ed3348d4-cfc3-441b-a921-539aa1a486b6">

I selected black, red, and grey for their eye-friendly appeal, and the straightforward, laid-back aesthetic significantly enhances the prominence of the images.

## Fonts
I explored font options for this web design on the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website, settling on these fonts to impart a sense of elegance and cleanliness to the overall look.

## Icons
<img width="386" alt="footer" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/b181bc8f-b843-49f1-9d92-64d83aac0585">

The social media icons featured in the footer are sourced from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
website.

## Features
### Page Elements

The navigation bar is consistently positioned at the top of each page. I incorporated the "fixed-top" attribute with Bootstrap to ensure the bar remains fixed at the top, providing users with convenient navigation, even as they scroll down.

<img width="404" alt="mobile nav" src="https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Delish-Dining-Delight/assets/126810074/9c4e2256-8a97-4668-a455-307e6f8ae4cc">

This is the mobile navigation bar, featuring a simple design. I've implemented a collapsible hamburger menu for enhanced user mobility.

**GitHub Issues**

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/django-blog-starter-files/issues) served as another Agile tool for this project. Here, I employed my own user story template and bug template to keep track of my progress in the website development process.

## **Unresolved Bugs**

- On the post detail page, the post likes and comments total are displayed next to an icon without any issues, as shown in the image above. 
However, on the index page, the comment total doesn't display, but the likes total does. I attempted to resolve this issue by removing and adding the 'post.' prefix, but it was still unsuccessful.

- This bug is particularly weird. In the **@media** decorator, when I set the height to 150px, it looks perfect on larger screens, but on the phone, the translucent mask layer only covers half of the image. However, when I set the height to 250px, it looks perfect on mobile devices, but now on larger screens, the translucent mask layer extends below the hero image, which doesn't look appealing. For now, I've prioritized the appearance on larger screens.

- A bug I encountered on the post detail page was the spacing between the icon and the number. While the likes icon and the like total are nicely spaced, the comment number either displays below the comment or too close to the icon. When I add a space between the icon and {{Total comment}}, the total comment displays below the icon. However, without the space, it displays beside the icon, but it's too close to the icon.

- On the Contact/Order page My intention with this JavaScript code was to filter out necessary items from the menu. However, after extensive attempts to make it work properly, I couldn't figure out how to get it to function correctly. 
I attempted to use AI assistance but still couldn't find a solution. It either incorrectly classified each individual word as invalid or failed to detect the error altogether.

- One daunting issue I faced was on the contact page, where for some reason the footer would display at the center middle of the screen. I addressed this problem by completely rearranging the position of the inputs, which resulted in a better layout than the original one in the end.

- A challenge I encountered arose when using the Zoho mail server. It failed to forward my emails to the client unless I manually confirmed and resent the email. This workflow proved highly inefficient, prompting me to seek an alternative solution. I made the decision to switch to the Gmail SMTP server, and after making a few adjustments and verifications, the issue was resolved satisfactorily.

- Another challenge I encountered occurred on the register page. Suddenly, I found myself unable to register any accounts on my website, which was perplexing given that everything seemed to be functioning properly until then. To tackle this unexpected issue, I took the approach of creating a new startapp that included two templates, one for the register page and the other for the login page, along with a Python form model. After integrating and configuring everything accordingly, the register template began to function as expected once again, and the login page operated smoothly as well.

- The error occurred because I forgot to verify my device in the Google settings. Google, for security reasons, was blocking my app from sending emails through its platform.
